## Scenario 5: Weather API Simulation

**Description:**  
This scenario simulates fetching weather data asynchronously. It demonstrates how promises, `setTimeout`, and random delays can be used to mimic API behavior.

**Code Types:**  
- **Type 1:** Direct promise with nested timeouts (raw version showing thought process).  
- **Type 2:** Promise with `Promise.race` to simulate timeout handling (more realistic approach, but still kept raw for learning purposes).

**Learning Outcome:**  
- Handling asynchronous tasks with promises.  
- Simulating real-world API delays and failures.  
- Understanding the difference between raw experimentation and structured approach.
