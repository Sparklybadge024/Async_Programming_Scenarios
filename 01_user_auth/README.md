# Async JS Real-World Scenario 1: User Authentication

This file contains 3 types of implementations for a user authentication system using JavaScript Promises:

1. **Type 1**: Check username and password together
2. **Type 2**: Separate username and password verification
3. **Type 3**: Add a new user and set password asynchronously

It demonstrates asynchronous behavior using `setTimeout` and Promise chaining.

## Notes
- Type 1: Basic username/password check
- Type 2: Shows sequential async checks for username and password
- Type 3: Demonstrates adding a new user and setting a password asynchronously
