# Async Programming Scenarios in JavaScript

This repository contains real-world scenarios implemented using JavaScript Promises and asynchronous programming techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Scenarios

1. [User Authentication](./01_user_auth/README.md)  
   - Check username and password with async simulation.  
   - Add new users and assign passwords.  

2. [Image Loading](./02_image_loading/README.md)  
   - Simulates async image loading.  
   - Uses `Promise.race`, `Promise.allSettled`, and error handling.  

3. [User Profiles & Posts](./03_user_profile_posts/README.md)  
   - Fetch profiles and posts asynchronously.  
   - Examples in parallel, series, and extended details.  

4. [Competing Servers (Promise.race)](./04_competing_servers/README.md)  
   - Simulates fetching from multiple servers with random delays.  
   - Demonstrates `Promise.race()` behavior.  

5. [Weather API Simulation](https://github.com/Sparklybadge024/Async_Programming_Scenarios/tree/main/05_weather_fetch.js#readme)
   Simulates fetching weather information asynchronously with random delays and errors.  
   - Learnings: Handling promises with `setTimeout`, simulating real-world API delays.

6. [File Download Progress Simulation](06_File_Download_Progress/README.md)
   - This project simulates file downloading with progress updates and intermittent connection interruptions. It demonstrates asynchronous JavaScript using Promises and setTimeout to mimic real-world file downloads.

7. [API Batching](07_API_Batching/README.md)
   - This project demonstrates API call batching in JavaScript using Promises. It simulates multiple API requests with random success/failure and allows processing them in batches, ensuring efficient and controlled execution.

8. [Order Processing](08_Order_Processing/README.md)
   - Currently in prograss but i have made this project based on the research i did on e-commerce backend operation and made a simulation of of the processes involved while processing an operation.
   
## ðŸš€ Goal
This repo is part of my journey to master asynchronous programming in JavaScript. Each scenario reflects real-world cases where async logic is crucial.
