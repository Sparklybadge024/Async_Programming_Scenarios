# Async Programming Scenarios in JavaScript

This repository contains real-world scenarios implemented using JavaScript Promises and asynchronous programming techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Scenarios

1. [User Authentication](./01_user_auth/README.md)  
   - Check username and password with async simulation.  
   - Add new users and assign passwords.  

2. [Image Loading](./02_image_loading/README.md)  
   - Simulates async image loading.  
   - Uses `Promise.race`, `Promise.allSettled`, and error handling.  

## ðŸš€ Goal
This repo is part of my journey to master asynchronous programming in JavaScript. Each scenario reflects real-world cases where async logic is crucial.
