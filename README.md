# Async Programming Scenarios in JavaScript

This repository contains real-world scenarios implemented using JavaScript Promises and asynchronous programming techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Scenarios

1. [User Authentication](./01_user_auth/README.md)  
   - Check username and password with async simulation.  
   - Add new users and assign passwords.  

2. [Image Loading](./02_image_loading/README.md)  
   - Simulates async image loading.  
   - Uses `Promise.race`, `Promise.allSettled`, and error handling.  

3. [User Profiles & Posts](./03_user_profile_posts/README.md)  
   - Fetch profiles and posts asynchronously.  
   - Examples in parallel, series, and extended details.  

4. [Competing Servers (Promise.race)](./04_competing_servers/README.md)  
   - Simulates fetching from multiple servers with random delays.  
   - Demonstrates `Promise.race()` behavior.  

5. [Weather API Simulation:](https://github.com/Sparklybadge024/Async_Programming_Scenarios/tree/main/05_weather_fetch.js#readme)
   Simulates fetching weather information asynchronously with random delays and errors.  
   - Learnings: Handling promises with `setTimeout`, simulating real-world API delays.
## ðŸš€ Goal
This repo is part of my journey to master asynchronous programming in JavaScript. Each scenario reflects real-world cases where async logic is crucial.
